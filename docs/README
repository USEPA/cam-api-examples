# GitHub Page on Clean Air Markets ECMPS Beta API Examples

The Github page for ECMPS Beta API Examples is hosted at <https://usepa.github.io/cam-api-examples>.

## Run Locally
After forking this repo, `cd .\docs\` then run the following commands:

```
npm install
npx gulp compile
npx gulp init
npm run build
```

In the `dist` folder, open `index.html` in your browser.

## Updating the GitHub Page 

### Content
Content is maintained in the `/src/content/` folder using markdown files. This contains all of the text in their respective places. For example, the `simple-config-ex-1.md` file will render to the `<div id="simple-config-ex-1"></div>` in the `/dist/index.html` file. You will also need to use the `/src/index.js` which is a file that handles all the API calls and other javascript for each example. For API returns there are element styles for a code response or a table response. Using previous examples to follow the same format.

### Javascript and API calls
Inside the `/src/index.js` has the code for connecting the markdown files to the respective `<div>` elements. The js file also has the code for making the API calls. 

### Adding an example/content
1. Add a `div` tag in the `/dist/index.html` with an id to connect the markdown file to the element. (ex. `<div id="simple-config-ex-1"></div>`)
2. Create a new markdown file for the section in the `/src/content/` directory (ex. `simple-config-ex-1.md`).
3. Add code to insert the markdown in the `/src/index.js` like the example here:
```
import mdSimpleConfig1 from "./content/simple-config-ex-1.md";
document.getElementById("simple-config-ex-1").innerHTML = mdSimpleConfig1;
```
4. Add an API call (if applicable) to add a call to fill in a response return or table return (use previous examples to help).
5. Push changes to main (there is a GitHub action that will run and update the page automatically [action runs when changes are pushed]).
