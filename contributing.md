## What we're looking for

The purpose of this repo is to provide our users examples to help them get started using the CAM APIs so we'd like to keep things simple. However, we're happy to look at all examples because we want to learn more about how people use these APIs.

A couple things we're looking for
- examples using additional programming languages
- things we missed in the examples that is useful to you
