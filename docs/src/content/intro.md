# Clean Air Markets ECMPS Beta API Examples

❗**This example page uses beta (non production) APIs**❗

This page provides examples using Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interfaces (API) for accessing data that the Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) collects to run programs designed to reduce air pollution from power plants.

In particular, there are a specific set of APIs used for the Emissions Collection and Monitoring Plan System (ECMPS) 2.0 Beta application. For more information on ECMPS 2.0 application, please visit [Frequent Questions about the CAMD Re-engineering Effort](https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/frequent-questions-about-camd-re-engineering-effort). The examples below show how the ECMPS Beta API endpoints could be used to find useful information you may be looking for. To use the API endpoints in this demo, you only need an API key. If you do not have an API key, you can [request one here](https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/cam-api-portal#/api-key-signup). However, there are endpoints in the APIs that require a token as well. Generally the endpoints that require a token have the word "workspace" in the endpoint name. For a full list of endpoints, please see the CAM API [documentation page](https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/cam-api-portal#/documentation).
